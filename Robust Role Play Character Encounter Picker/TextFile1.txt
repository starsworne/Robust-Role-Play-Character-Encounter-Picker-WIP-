This program will have a back end list of characters.
These characters will be tagged for player, location, organizational
affiliation, and plot connection.
It will then allow you to generate character combinations such that
one character will be given for each role player in each combination.
If you would like to limit it to a given location, organizational affiliation,
and plot connection, you can. These options will be chooseable.
Up to 3 character combinations will be allowed per roll.


Example character profile:

Character Number: 1
Name: Veryn
Role Player: Runa
Organizational Affiliations: Any, Horde, Quel'thalas, House Sunbound, Ebon Blade, Eversong Holding
Settings: Any, Quel'thalas, Eversong Holding, Silvermoon City
Traveling Settings: Any, Lithelien, Adventurer


There will also be buttons that will allow one prompt to be generated for either a plot-focused or a genre focused RP.

Example return:

Novareth in a Feelings RP
Eledris in an Undead Social Justice RP

To facilitate this, there will be a list of genres and a list of plots.
